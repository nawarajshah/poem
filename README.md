Oh, Git, thou art a wondrous thing,<br>
A tool to help us all our code to cling.<br>
With branches and commits and tags galore,<br>
You make it easy to keep our code in store.<br>

When things go wrong, you're there to save the day,<br>
With your ability to roll back changes without dismay.<br>
You let us work on our code in peace,<br>
Knowing that we can always go back to a previous release.<br>
